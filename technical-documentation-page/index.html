          <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive,   
             object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It 
             was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like 
             Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU 
             General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough 
             understanding on Python programming language.</p>
          
          <p>This tutorial is designed for software programmers who 
             need to learn Python programming language from 
             scratch.</p>
          
          <p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer 
             Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any 
             of the programming languages is a plus.</p>

        <article>
          <p>Python's features include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Easy to learn − Python has few keywords, simple 
                structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows  
                the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
            <li>Easy to read − Python code is more clearly defined and 
                visible to the eyes.</li>
            <li>Easy to maintain − Python's source code is fairly 
                easy-to-maintain</li>
            <li>A broad standard library − Python's bulk of the 
                library is very portable and cross-platform compatible 
                on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
            <li>Interactive Mode − Python has support for an  
                interactive mode which allows interactive testing and 
                debugging of snippets of code.</li>
            <li>Portable − Python can run on a wide variety of 
                hardware platforms and has the same interface on all 
                platforms.</li>
            <li>Extendable − You can add low-level modules to the 
                Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers 
                to add to or customize their tools to be more 
                efficient.</li>
            <li>Databases − Python provides interfaces to all major 
                commercial databases.</li>
            <li>GUI Programming − Python supports GUI applications 7
                that can be created and ported to many system calls, 
                libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, 
                Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
            <li>Scalable − Python provides a better structure and 
                support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Invoking the interpreter with a script parameter begins 
             execution of the script and continues until the script is 
             finished. When the script is finished, the interpreter is 
             no longer active.</p>
          
          <p>Let us write a simple Python program in a script. Python 
             files have extension .py. Type the following source code 
             in a test.py file.</p>
          
          <code>print "Hello, Python!"</code>
          
          <p>We assume that you have Python interpreter set in PATH 
            variable. Now, try to run this program as follows -</p>
          
          <code>$ python test.py</code>
          
          <p>This produces the following result −</p>
          
          <code>Hello, Python!</code>

        <header>Assigning Values to Variables</header><hr>
        <article>
          <p>Python variables do not need explicit declaration to 
             reserve memory space. The declaration happens 
             automatically when you assign a value to a variable. The 
             equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. </p>
          
          <p>The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the 
             variable and the operand to the right of the = operator is the 
             value stored in the variable. For example −</p>
          
          <code>
            #!/usr/bin/python

            counter = 100          # An integer assignment
            miles   = 1000.0       # A floating point
            name    = "John"       # A string

            print counter
            print miles
            print name
          </code>
          
          <p>Here, 100, 1000.0 and "John" are the values assigned to counter, 
             miles, and name variables, respectively. This produces the 
             following result −</p>
          
          <code>
            100
            1000.0
            John

        <header>Python Lists</header><hr>
        <article>
          <p>Lists are the most versatile of Python's compound data types. A 
          list contains items separated by commas and enclosed within square 
          brackets ([]). To some extent, lists are similar to arrays in C. 
          One difference between them is that all the items belonging to a 
          list can be of different data type.</p>


          <p>The values stored in a list can be accessed using the slice 
          operator ([ ] and [:]) with indexes starting at 0 in the beginning 
          of the list and working their way to end -1. The plus (+) sign is 
          the list concatenation operator, and the asterisk (*) is the 
          repetition operator. For example −</p>
          
          <code>
            #!/usr/bin/python

            list = [ 'abcd', 786 , 2.23, 'john', 70.2 ]
            tinylist = [123, 'john']

            print list          # Prints complete list
            print list[0]       # Prints first element of the list
            print list[1:3]     # Prints elements starting from 2nd till 3rd 
            print list[2:]      # Prints elements starting from 3rd element
            print tinylist * 2  # Prints list two times
            print list + tinylist # Prints concatenated lists
          </code>
          
          <p>This produce the following result −</p>

          <code>
            ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2]
            abcd
            [786, 2.23]
            [2.23, 'john', 70.2]
            [123, 'john', 123, 'john']
            ['abcd', 786, 2.23, 'john', 70.2, 123, 'john']
          </code>
