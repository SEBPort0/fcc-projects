        <h3>Biography</h3>
        <p>Favaloro was born and raised in La Plata. </p>
        <p>He was admitted into the Colegio Nacional de La Plata in 1936. After 
           graduating from high school, he was admitted to the School of Medicine 
           at the National University of La Plata. Favaloro graduated with a 
           medical degree in 1949.</p>
        <p>Following graduation, he moved to a small town named Jacinto Aráuz in 
           La Pampa Province after being offered a job as the town's 
           doctor. He married María Antonia Delgado in 1951.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of 1967, Favaloro began to consider the possibility 
           of using the saphenous vein in coronary surgery. He put his ideas 
           into practice for the first time in May of that year. The basic 
           principle was to bypass a diseased (obstructed) segment in a coronary 
           artery in order to deliver blood flow distally. The standardization 
           of this technique, called coronary artery bypass surgery, was the 
           fundamental work of his career, and ensured that his prestige would 
           transcend the limits of his country, as the procedure radically 
           changed the treatment of coronary disease.</p>
